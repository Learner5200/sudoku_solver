# Sudoku Solver

* A simple project based on a codewars kata.
* To solve a sudoku, initialise a Grid object with your sudoku represented as a two-dimensional array, then simply call the Grid#solve method, which will return the solved sudoku (or an error message if it cannot be solved by 'brute force').
